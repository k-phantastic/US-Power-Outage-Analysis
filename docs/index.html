        <h1>Welcome to the US Power Outage Analysis Project</h1>
        <p>This project analyzes a comprehensive dataset of power outages across the United States, utilizing data
            sourced from Purdue University.</p>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>Our dashboard and analysis aim to uncover underlying trends, seasonal patterns, and geographical
                distributions of power grid disturbances. We examine how different factors contribute to these outages
                and their overall impact.</p>

            <h2>Hypothesis Testing</h2>
            <p>Our Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) indicates that different causes may lead to varying outage durations.
                To determine if this difference is statistically significant, we designed the following test:</p>

            <div class="hypothesis-box">
                <p><strong>Null Hypothesis (H₀):</strong> The distribution of outage durations is the same for outages
                    caused by <em>severe weather</em> and <em>equipment failure</em>. Any observed difference is simply
                    due to random chance.</p>
                <p><strong>Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):</strong> Outages caused by <em>severe weather</em> have a longer
                    average duration than those caused by <em>equipment failure</em>.</p>
                <p><strong>Test Statistic:</strong> Difference in group means (Mean Duration of Severe Weather − Mean
                    Duration of Equipment Failure).</p>
